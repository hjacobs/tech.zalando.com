We spice up our days (and nights) with all kinds of fun and informative events.  At Zalando Technology we attach high importance to connect with other people within and without Zalando to share expertise and ideas. When it comes to internal relations we regularly hold Tech Talks. Sometimes we welcome guest speakers, either from another team within Zalando or a subject matter expert in Berlin. During these talks, presenters share issues that they are passionate about with an audience of about 20-100 people. Once in while we even make a full stop and focus on playful innovation and experimentation: We are proud of Hack Week – one week for over 400 people to brainstorm and execute their very own ideas without limits across teams, functions and several office locations. Furthermore we have the opportunity to attend or speak at `tech conferences`_ across Europe. In order to support local tech communities we regularly host meet-ups. Furthermore we invest in `university relations`_, do workshops and participate in career fairs. All in all, attending these and other events is a great chance for us to develop ourselfs and others in terms of tech- greatness!
