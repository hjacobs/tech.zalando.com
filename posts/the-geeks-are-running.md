-running-zalando-geek.jpg) Last Friday Berlin’s Tiergarten was invaded by one
particular kind of geeks - athletes! About 400 Zalandos were at the [14th
Berliner 5 x 5 km Team-Relay](http://www.berliner-teamstaffel.de/) event,
including some from the geek squad! Not even a very rainy afternoon broke our
motivation to run the 5km in
[Tiergarten](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gro%C3%9Fer_Tiergarten). For me this
was the first 5km event I had taken part in, and it was really great! I must
confess that after the fourth kilometer I was feeling a bit tired, but all the
cheering from my Zalando colleagues gave me the strength required to run fast
to the end.  As you can see below, everyone at Zalando Tech took their “run-
time” very seriously (pun intended) and only took a rest once they had crossed
the finish line. [![Martin Bell](/files/2013/06/Martin-Bell-running-

You can check the final Standings of the event [here](http://www.berliner-
teamstaffel.de/ergebnisse-und-teilnehmerliste/ergebnisse.html) by selecting
day number three. See if you can find us (hint you can filter teams with
“Zala” ;-) ). Props to Sven, Georg, Christian, Olaf and Enrico of Team Zalando
Rollator for their performance, finishing as the fastest Tech-only team with
an overall time of 02:01:27. Pursued by our HR colleagues the “Nerd Hunters”,
all eight technology teams put their running shoes to the test and showed
great team spirit. [Pretty good!](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_05qJTeNNI)
All in all it was a really fun afternoon where all of us got together. A big
thank you goes out from my relay team to everyone who was at the race (either
running or cheering)
