In the past four years, Zalando has experienced extremely
rapid growth, becoming one of Europe’s largest online fashion shops.  During
this period, the German market has seen a similar increase in the usage of
Internet on mobile devices. In 2008 around 3.2 million German mobile users
were using their devices to surf the net. By 2011 this number soared almost
1000 percent to 30 million users. In response to this new market, Zalando is
now available to mobile users via our user-friendly mobile platform, offering
customers the perfect mobile shopping experience.

## Second Screen more popular than ever
The term "Second Screen" is used to describe the practice of using a smart
phone or tablet at the same time as watching TV. Our statistics suggest that
second screeners often do some shopping on our site after seeing one of our
ads on TV.

And since service is our top priority, we launched a mobile website
in 2011 to supplement our online shop. On our mobile site, customers can
comfortably shop from their smart phones, no matter where they are. The number
of visits to the mobile shop increased threefold within a year and now
accounts for 25 percent of all visits. Today, 1 out of every 10 Euros spent on
Zalando is from an order placed on the mobile site. This upward trend shows no
signs of slowing.

No one is shocked by the success of mobile Internet. In
order to give a solid technical base for mobile shopping, the platform and
mobile apps must be linked securely. We have therefore developed a rating
based on a Spring MVC REST API that ensures secure communication between our
platform and mobile apps. To ensure consistently high quality throughout the
software life cycle, we focus on continuous delivery using Jenkins, manage our
source code in Git and build our apps with the build tool Gradle.

## Apple App Store, Google Play, Windows Store
After the completion of the Mobile-API, we launched the Zalando tablet app for
Windows 8 by the end of October 2012 – to coincide with the launch Microsoft’s
new operating system for desktops and tablets.

Of course we can’t stop with
Windows, so parallel to this launch we’ll continue working on our iPhone app,
which has been available in the Apple Apps Store since December 2012. The
high, pent-up demand for our iPhone app amongst the loyal iPhone user base was
clear from the start. After a few days, the app topped the "Lifestyle"
category in the Apple Apps Store.

At the same time, we are now working hard to
finalise the app for Android smart phones, so that Android users can also
enjoy the seamless shopping experience.

In order to offer the same high
quality and security as well as the trademark look and feel of Zalando, we
keep a firm eye on the design and development of our apps. Our Product
Management works closely with the IT Security Team and the Usability Experts
from our Onsite Innovation Team. The mobile developers are brought in to work
on these projects at a very early stage, to ensure that we create the best
apps for our users.

## What’s next?
There is still a lot to do, but our calendars are filling up. Alongside the
ongoing optimisation of our Mobile API, both the apps and our mobile website
will receive regular updates. This process will allow users’ wishes to be
implemented as well as allowing us to roll out functions that are already used
by millions of satisfied customers of our online shop.

In addition, the native
device functions such as the acceleration sensor, GPS, camera, etc., offer
many possibilities for innovation. These features can be harnessed to further
improve the Zalando shopping experience, making it more exciting and more
secure.

The mobile revolution is here. And it’s really something to get excited about!
