Earlier this year, we reported about `Hack Week`_, the first open innovation week
where Zalando Technology experiments without limits. Now, in the middle of June,
we have “celebrated” it for the `second time`_, again with very positive outcome
and new learnings. We are quite excited to see how Hack Week has grown from a
fun little side show into a cornerstone of Zalando’s innovation culture. This
time around, Hack Week also involved a few other Zalando departments and
attracted a lot of attention from the executive board, journalists,
bloggers and even the `state government`_.

.. TEASER_END

It all started with a little kick-off event reminding everyone about the process
and schedule. Each day was again accompanied by a few side shows that helped to
strengthen the team spirit – video games, `office golf`_ and public viewing of the
FIFA World Cup opening match.

Hack Week ended with the closing event where again ten `handmade trophies`_ were
awarded to the most distinctive projects along with our special guests from the
Management Board – Robert, David and Rubin. Two new awards were presented this
time – the Bridge Builder award for projects fostering collaboration across
departments, and Andy Warhol for the most creative project or optionally the
most creative presentation.

Putting the event together was much easier this time. The organization team was
already experienced, and the staff knew the whole ideation process and what to
expect from it. The atmosphere was very open, playful and laid-back with people
brainstorming everywhere. All project teams were very focused on delivering
results and thus devoted themselves to whatever they pursued with a lot of
passion.

Open innovation is daily business
---------------------------------

A lot of these Hack Week projects help us to innovate the customer experience.
They have an impact on how customers perceive and interact with Zalando – now or
in the long-term. Even more so they help to make our internal processes much
more efficient. Be it logistics processes at our warehouses, or within our
engineering department through the development of internal tools and little
helpers that improve the way we plan, build and test software features (see one example `here`_).

Additionally, Hack Week is all about thinking outside the box and working across
teams and boundaries. Therefore it is crucial that people with different
backgrounds and ideas develop solutions together – all that without the bias,
blinkers and pressure imposed by daily business. As a result, we achieve a very
positive impact on our work environment and company culture – characterized by
teamwork, creativity and playful innovation – that we do not want to spare in
this rapidly growing organization.

But Hack Week is just a tiny little extract of a full year's worth of innovative
capacity. Therefore our goal is to take open ideation to the next level and
enable such groundbreaking collaborations throughout the year. An update on how
to make that part of our daily business will follow.
