Gruenderwoche-28.jpg) Delicious burgers at Burgeramt Friedrichshain, an
exciting tour through the museum of computer games, a boat trip to discover
one of the most beautiful cities from water made it a great and funny weekend
with the winners of last year’s hackathon at [RWTH Aachen.](http://www.rwth-
aachen.de/) The hackathon was taking place during the entrepreneurship week
and was sponsored by Zalando and Wooga.The students Simon, Frederik, Lars and
Matthias, working on their bachelor degrees in computer science, won a weekend
in Berlin for their great achievements in building an app in just a few hours.
Before the Berlin tour on Saturday, our winners had the chance to take a peek
behind the scenes of the Zalando Technology department. Philipp Erler, our
Chief Information Officer, took some time to give our winners a personal tour
through the different departments and teams of Zalando Technology. The
students got deep insights into our organizational structure, our current
tasks, our achievements so far as well as the main projects for 2013. And
since last years hackathon had a focus on mobile gaming and apps, they got the
chance to join our mobile team on Friday afternoon. The challenge was to get
some ideas for designing and implementing an endless view pager element for
Android to support infinite swiping through the views. Of course, there is no
quick solution that can be developed in just two hours, but the students did
very well in bringing their competence to the challenge! We had a lot of fun
with our guests from Aachen and we hope that there will be another chance to
meet up with the next generation of talented programmers soon. **We also got
really good feedback from our guests. Here some statements from Frederik,
Simon and Lars:** Frederik: "_A few things, which surprised me: The huge
amount of developers, who work on an online fashion shop. I got an idea about
the gigantic technical effort, which is needed to run a shop like Zalando.
Besides of that I was amazed by the development of an own Shop System, which
guarantees, that you deliver all from one source. I was also impressed by the
nice working atmosphere, which I already got to know during lunch break with
the Mobile team. Last but not least I kind of changed my mind about Zalando as
beeing just an online fashion retailer. It is a technical masterpiece!”_
Simon: _“I was quite surprised, how many system components Zalando develops on
its own. Before I came here, I thought, that most of the developers work on
the shop. But actually it is the opposite! Apart from that our visit at the
[computer game museum](http://www.computerspielemuseum.de/) as well as our
evening at the [Blue Men Group](http://www.stage-entertainment.de/musicals-
shows/blue-man-group-berlin.html) were real highlights of our weekend in
Berlin.”_ Lars: _“Berlin is a very cool city with enough room to catch up with
like-minded people. It offers a huge tech start-up scene, which brings a
dynamic in the city, which I really love. Even though I do not see Zalando as
a real start-up anymore, it still gave me that dynamic feeling. It is quite a
challenge for big companies to keep the start-up spirit. The technical effort
to run an online fashion shop impressed me a lot. To be honest, I wouldn’t
have thought that there are so many developers behind the scenes of Zalando.
As a brand Zalando has quite a name, but as far as I recognized it before, not
as a tech company yet. After this weekend I got a complete new picture. As a
passionate gamer I liked our trip to game museum as well. Thanks for the time
you spend with us. Not only to show us the company but also to take us through
Berlin!”_ [![Testings the originals computer games museum](/files/2013/07/IMG-
