Exactly after seven months in [Apple’s App Store](https://itunes.apple.com/de/app/zalando-mobil/id585629514?mt=8) and just three months in the [Google Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=de.zalando.mobile), the
Zalando smartphone apps have reached a pretty cool milestone.

<!-- TEASER_END -->

  * 1 million downloads in Germany within seven months
  * 2 thirds iOS smartphones, 1 third Android phones
  * 1 of every 25 smartphones in Germany runs a Zalando mobile app (Source: ComScore)
  * Every fifth user visits Zalando through a mobile device

We are proud that our customers love our apps so much and want to thank our
users for providing us with useful feedback that enables us to make the apps
even better. Also a special thanks goes to the Zalando Technology Mobile App
Team, which made this possible.

Our users can really look forward to the next generation of Android and iOS
apps which will be launched in the next couple of days and they will come
along with a number of new useful features. Apart from that, we are already
working on a project which will be very interesting for our iPad users. Not
only that, we also plan to rollout our apps outside of Germany. Stay tuned!
