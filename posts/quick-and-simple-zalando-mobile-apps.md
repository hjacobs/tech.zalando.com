It has been almost one year since we launched our first
Zalando App. The launch is quite a success story - in July 2013 we already
achieved [one million downloads](http://tech.zalando.com/zalando-mobile-apps-
reached-1-mio-downloads/) after just three months in [Apple's App
store](https://itunes.apple.com/de/app/zalando-mobil/id585629514?mt=8) and
seven months in [Google Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=de.zalando.mobile).
Recently, we hit the two million download mark!

 Yesterday, Idealo came up
with a [test report](http://apps.idealo.de/news/zalando-app-so-geht-modernes-
einkaufen.html) on our App. Unfortunately, the post is in German so we will
share the main facts with you here in our blog. Besides very good rating for
app functionality in general, we got nice feedback on the following features:

  * The styleshaker, a fashion generator, will provide the customers with inspiration of new outfit creations. With styleshaker, you can share the created outfit within your social community!
  * The barcodes scanner facilitates the connection between off- and online shopping. Found a nice dress in a store? Check whether it is available at Zalando, too!
  * The Zalando magazine is also integrated in the app. Want to get the latest fashion news? Just receive regular updates on your smartphone!
  * Last but not least, when the user is logged in to the app, cart and wish list are synchronized through the Zalando user account.

## My Retrospect And Outlook

The development time of the Zalando iPhone app
took us around five months. However, at the same time we put the first Mobile
API version in place as well. All our apps are connected to our shop system
via this API. We updated our iPhone app four times since it went live a year
ago. Generally, building an app for Android is a comparable degree of effort.
However, in case of the first version of our Android app, we developed it in
only eleven weeks. That was not only because of the Mobile API already having
been developed, but also because of the motivated development team. The
biggest challenge about product presentation on smartphones is to give the
user all information he needs for shopping without overloading the small
display. Furthermore mobile internet limits the possibilities having better
images in terms of file size and image quality. We are currently working on
the so called universal app for iPhones and iPads which will be launched
pretty soon. Early next year, we will rollout our iOS and Android apps across
Europe which will be followed by our Android universal app. Stay tuned!
