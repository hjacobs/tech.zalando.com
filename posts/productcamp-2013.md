What sounds like yet another article about one of our team events, is actually a report dealing with this year’s
Productcamp Berlin 2013 - an (un)conference where Product Managers shared their knowledge and experience.

<!-- TEASER_END -->

## What is it all about?

The basic task of product managers is specifying and prioritizing new features of their product,
and managing the development - for a more detailed definition take a closer look [here](http://tech.zalando.com/team/).
Besides the need for solid technical knowledge and social skills, it is also about being good at managing the development
of software products / projects, which exactly was the scope of this (un)conference.

The goal behind this (un)conference is that each visitor is not only a passive listener, but also able to play an active role by engaging as a speaker and/or
organizer of the so called "panels". The event was attended by those within such job titles as: product managers (owners),
project managers or scrum trainers. Thus a wide range of professional expertise was present. Obviously, most of the
attendees were encouraged to foster discussions about topics they know best about.

Before the Productcamp really started,
topics were gathered by filling up a schedule with the introduced panels as shown in the picture below.

Many of these panels or sessions dealt with techniques and best practices used in daily tasks in product management.
For a better understanding, I would like to provide a closer look at two of my favorite panels of this day.
Both involved managing planned features on roadmaps whilst not losing the ability to handle bugs, incidents and
feature requests, as well as staying agile.

The first panel was held by a product manager who gained a lot of experience
helping famous Berlin based start-ups by bringing their "product" live. As
Zalando is still a rather young company itself, this session was very
inspiring in terms of fast-tracking product innovations. The session was
called "Scrum vs. Kanban" and it emphasized the separation of "feature-pools"
of medium/long-term planned features and incoming bugs or urgent requests in
highly dynamic environments. Such requests can cause huge backlogs. The idea
is not simply to separate the pools, but also treat them differently in terms
of management principles. The first one is meant to be managed by a known
"SCRUM sprinting" principle and the other one by a "KANBAN pulling" principle,
where developers can choose tickets from a prepared backlog. When using these
concepts, it is possible to eliminate huge backlogs without affecting the
development of planned features.

The second panel was more an open
discussion about the merits of roadmapping in an agile development. In the
past, software development was often managed by the so called “waterfall
models”. This means steady phases have to be finished until the next phase
could be started. These methods might fit for a steady and structured
development and in return a good commitment to deadlines is possible.
Nowadays, however, in order to act faster, more agile and iterative, other
software development methods like the Scrum principles are used. Roadmapping
is a challenge here. The best credo I have heard in this discussion about
working in an agile environment was: “Take roadmaps as a planning, but never
commit to deadlines”. Now, the only challenge is telling your stakeholders.
After all, there is one truth: you’re not agile anymore if you have a fixed
long term planning. :)

## So what are the learnings?

Personally, I think the Productcamp 2013 was worthwhile
attending, even though it was on a Saturday - and not just because of the
after show party!! The bottom line is, that it was a free transfer of
knowledge with the ability to meet some interesting people. It also showed
that the work in product management and development principles here at Zalando
Technology are really more than “state-of-the-art” compared to others in
software development. Talking about how problems and developments are handled
in other companies revealed just how highly efficient and sustainable Zalando
really is in developing our ZEOS (find more information
[here](http://tech.zalando.com/my-three-year-journey-into-zalando-technology/)). Actually getting things done without loosing time in fixed organizational structures is just one of the reasons why working here is a lot
of fun. And even if it might get complicated from time to time - the useful
experience of other product managers may help. So this is why we are looking
forward to next years product camp - would you like to join as well?
