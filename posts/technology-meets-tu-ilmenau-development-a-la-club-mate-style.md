At Zalando Technology we love [Club-Mate](http://www.clubmate.de/). And, we
are totally in love with our own logistics software
[ZALOS](http://tech.zalando.com/the-evolution-of-zalos-the-story-behind-
zalando-logistics/). When we were asked to do a workshop in the context of the
[sci business week](http://www.sci-business-week.de/) at [TU
Ilmenau](http://www.tu-ilmenau.de/), we had to put our deeply loved ones into
the concept. Themed “Agile software engineering for Europe’s biggest wardrobe.
From idea to software – in one workshop” we challenged 20 participating
students: "Have you ever thought of developing logistics software for the
fulfillment of Club-Mate?" This was a felicitous surprise, as we could read
from the puzzled faces of the students - but the confusion quickly paved way
for a big fun for all of us. According to our hands-on mentality, it seemed
reasonable to put our students into the roles of a Zalando Technology scrum
team, so they could learn, how we work at Zalando Technology. And lucky us,
they weren`t complaining about the fact, that they did not have to listen to a
three hours theoretical speech :-)

[![Kick-
off](/files/2013/06/DSCN4311-300x225.jpg)](/files/2013/06/DSCN4311.jpg) The
main actors of the workshop were well cast: The participating students as
product managers and developers, Club-Mate as the product which needs to get
its own fulfillment and we Zalandos as mentors. The idea to experience agile
software development in an enterprise context was well received by the
students. And they took their roles quite seriously, becoming more and more
eager to see how we as Zalando leverage the benefits of in-house developed
software. Everything was framed alongside the bits and pieces of our own
logistics software ZALOS, which is already in use by all of our own
warehouses. We brought a handful of laptops, barcode scanners, Club-Mate, and
a "naked" ZALOS application for the students - waiting for new features.

[![Group discussions](/files/2013/06/DSCN4332-300x225.jpg)](/files/2013/06/DSC
N4332.jpg) While the product managers were heads-down into the Club-Mate
fulfillment specification, the engineers got used to our technology stack and
ZALOS' design principles. Diving into the technologies of our overarching ZEOS
platform, we introduced the students to the way we use PostgreSQL, stored
procedures to access the databases, our own Java webservice layer on top of
that, and a slim GUI frontend built in GWT. The developers were eager to
engineer the front- and backend features using pre-built artifacts of the
ZALOS core application, while the product managers supported them continously
and patiently. We were impressed how vividly developers and product managers
discussed the features and their options for implementation. Role playing a
second case study ensured that we also kept the pace high for our product
managers. Confronted with two completely opposing requirements and pushy
stakeholders from a real world example the PMs drafted a concept to fulfill
the conflicting requirements by a technology driven concept. Interesting and
surprising for us though, all solutions proposed some automation by machines,
rather than pragmatic software solutions. It was a great day at TU-Ilmenau. We
received excellent feedback from the students, especially for the fact, that
they had the opportunity to get such deep insights into how agile software
development at Zalando works. AND: They really loved the idea about an own
Club Mate fulfillment - What a blessing it is, when you know how much Club-
Mate is left in the fridge and when you have to order more just in time.

Convinced by the success of this workshop concept, we’ll be conducting many
more at other universites, too. For all the ones who love technology and Club-
Mate, as much as we do.

See you soon!
