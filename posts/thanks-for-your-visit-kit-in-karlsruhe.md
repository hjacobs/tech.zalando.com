Last week we built up our
Zalando stand at the KIT career fair in Karlsruhe and talked to many students
and graduates.

Lisa, Ellen, Marcel, and I were overwhelmed by the large number
of interested visitors who wanted to know how work is like at Zalando and who
asked for jobs, internships, or mentoring of bachelor and master theses.

<!-- TEASER_END -->

We learned that some students were quite surprised about seeing Zalando at a
career fair which had a strong technology or engineering focus. Questions like
"Are you selling shoes here?" or "What is Zalando doing here?" were sometimes
asked. So, we needed to create an awareness of Zalando Technology by
explaining what makes us the most fashionable tech company. Last but not least
we had a lot of fun! Thanks to all of you who dropped by. See you soon!
